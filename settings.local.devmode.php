 * excluded module had never been installed. When syncing configuration, if an
 * excluded module is already installed, it will not be uninstalled by the
 * configuration synchronization, and dependent configuration will remain
 * intact. This affects only configuration synchronization; single import and
 * export of configuration are not affected.
 *
 * Drupal does not validate or sanity check the list of excluded modules. For
 * instance, it is your own responsibility to never exclude required modules,
 * because it would mean that the exported configuration can not be imported
 * anymore.
 *

 * guarantees the configuration synchronization provides. It is not recommended
 * to use this feature with modules that affect Drupal in a major way such as
 * the language or field module.
