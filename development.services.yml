# Local development services.
#
# The development.services.yml file allows the developer to override
# container parameters for debugging.
#
# To activate this feature, follow the instructions at the top of the
# 'example.settings.local.php' file, which sits next to this file.
#
# Be aware that in Drupal's configuration system, all the files that
# provide container definitions are merged using a shallow merge approach
# within \Drupal\Core\DependencyInjection\YamlFileLoader.
# This means that if you want to override any value of a parameter, the
# whole parameter array needs to be copied from
# sites/default/default.services.yml or from core/core.services.yml file.
parameters:
  twig.config:
    # Twig debugging:
    #
    # When debugging is enabled:
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that
    #   contain theming information, such as template file name suggestions.
    # - Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    #   check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'debug'
    #   should be set to FALSE.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
    #
    # For more information about debugging Twig templates, see
    # https://www.drupal.org/node/1906392.

    # Enabling Twig debugging is not recommended in production environments.

    # Twig auto-reload:
    #
    # Automatically recompile Twig templates whenever the source code changes.
    # If you don't provide a value for auto_reload, it will be determined
    # based on the value of debug.
    #
    # Enabling auto-reload is not recommended in production environments.

    auto_reload: true
    # Twig cache:
    #
    # By default, Twig templates will be compiled and stored in the filesystem
    # to increase performance. Disabling the Twig cache will recompile the
    # templates from source each time they are used. In most cases the
    # auto_reload setting above should be enabled rather than disabling the
    # Twig cache.
    #
    # Disabling the Twig cache is not recommended in production environments.
    # @default true
