## Description: Delete all DB dumps saved by "ddev pull". Since those dumps are unsanitized until they get imported to a database, it is best to delete them if you plan to leave EU soil.
## Usage: travel-mode
## Example: "ddev travel-mode" 

# Prompt for the PROJECTS folder, default to one level up from the current project
GIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
DEFAULT_PATH=$(dirname "$GIT_ROOT")
read -p "Enter the path to the PROJECTS folder [default: $DEFAULT_PATH]: " PROJECTS
PROJECTS=${PROJECTS:-$DEFAULT_PATH}
PROJECTS=$(realpath "$PROJECTS")

# Check if the folder exists
if [ ! -d "$PROJECTS" ]; then
  echo "The folder '$PROJECTS' does not exist. Exiting."
  exit 1
fi

# Find files under .ddev/.downloads/*
echo "Listing files under .ddev/.downloads/ in $PROJECTS..."
find "$PROJECTS" -type f -path '*/.ddev/.downloads/*' -print

read -p "Type 'yes' to delete the files: " input
if [ "$input" == "yes" ]; then
  echo "Deleting..."
  find "$PROJECTS" -type f -path '*/.ddev/.downloads/*' -delete
  echo "Deletion complete."
  echo
  echo "To fully remove all projects type:"
  echo "ddev delete --all --clean-containers --omit-snapshot"
  echo "to delete all DDEV projects and their databases."
  echo "Pass -y if you don't want to be asked about every project"
else
  echo "You did not type 'yes'. Exiting..."
  exit 1
fi
